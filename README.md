A React boilerplate that started as an ejected [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Created as an opportunity to better understand webpack configuration, remove dependencies and serve as a customized app structure for smaller personal projects.

### `npm start`

Starts webpack's dev server at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with live reload, sass support and error overlays.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app from `./public` to `./build` with minification and hashed filenames.

### `npm test`

Coming soon. Consider using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for larger applications or when testing is desired.
